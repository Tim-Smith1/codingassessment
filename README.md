Ideally this app should be a JavaScript quiz.
When you click start you should be able to rotate through multiple choice questions.
Based on seconds left in the game your score would appear.
If you get wrong answer you lose 10 seconds.
At the end of the game you get redirected to a highscores page which stores your intials and score in local memory.
